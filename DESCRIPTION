Title: Fast Multivariate Normal and Student's t Methods
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2016-10-10
Author: Matteo Fasiolo, using the C++ parallel RNG of Thijs van den Berg and
    Ziggurat algorithm of Jens Maurer and Steven Watanabe (boost)
Maintainer: Matteo Fasiolo <matteo.fasiolo@gmail.com>
Description: Provides computationally efficient tools related to
    the multivariate normal and Student's t distributions. The main functionalities are:
    simulating multivariate random vectors, evaluating multivariate
    normal or Student's t densities and Mahalanobis distances. These tools are very efficient
    thanks to the use of C++ code and of the OpenMP API.
